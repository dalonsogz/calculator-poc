- src: provided source code, following a typical structure used in projects based in java-spring-boot-rest services development.
  - controller: classes exposing the API rest endpoints.
  
  - exception: custom exception classes and exception handling classes.
  - service/impl: classes that define the business operations.
  - resources: typically containing static resources like application configuration. In this project only the openapi res contract definition is needed.
  - test: classes to perform unit testing.


- target: code and relevant generated resources by maven.
  - generated-sources/openapi: sources generated by OpenAPI.
  - site: contains project information. Maven plugins are configured to generate code coverage and test results reports. 


### Dependencies
<a name="dependencies"/>

At the time of the first 'release' of the first 'alpha' version these are the main dependencies and versions used.

- Main dependencies:
  - Java 1.17
  - Spring Boot 3.1.0


- OpenAPI dependencies:
  - OpenApi 6.6.0
  - Swagger Annotations 1.6.0
  - Other OpenAPI supporting dependencies


- Provided dependencies:
  - Tracer 1.0.0


- Unit testing:
  - JUnit 5.9.3


- Reports and coverage:
  - Surefire 3.1.2
  - Jacoco 0.8.10

Also Apache Maven is needed to compile and run this project. Apache Maven v3.2.5 has been used for this development.

### Project scope
<a name="scope"/>

The main objective of this project is to provide a base 'skeleton', following the following requirements:

- Use of SpringBoot as a base framework.
- Source code generation, based on the definition of a REST contract (calculator-api.yml) using OpenAPI.
- Inclusion of the required dependency (Tracer.jar) using the 'maven-install-plugin' plugin.
- Handling of exceptions caused by invalid operations (@RestControllerAdvice, @ExceptionHandler).
- Unit tests using JUnit5.
- Use of SOLID principles.

The implemented functionality is that of a calculator capable of performing addition and subtraction, with BigDecimal operands.

### Compilation and quick-start
<a name="compilation"/>

To compile and start the application from scratch, clone the project from the repository and input these commands:

```commandline
mvn validate
mvn compile
mvn spring-boot:run
```

, a local web server will be started (8080 port by default), and you are ready to go.

Unit tests can be performed this way:

```commandline
mvn test
```

You can also build a 'web site' with maven, that provides several information about the project and the reports generated:

```commandline
mvn site
```

, then open in a web browser the generated file `./target/site/index.html`.

In 'Project Reports' section can be found the reports results (Surefire) and the code coverage (Jacoco) provided by the unit testing.


### Usage and examples

The endpoint to invoke the calculator functionality will be `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/calculate`

Also three needed parameters are mandatory:
- firstOperator, an integer or decimal number.
- secondOperator, an integer or decimal number.
- operation, a string that could be 'addition' or 'subtraction'

The string result of the operation will be returned.
If any of the parameters is missing or its value is invalid, a message alerting the user of the cause is returned as well.

#### Examples
<a name="examples"/>

Perform an addition operation:
```commandline
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/calculate?firstOperator=-4.2315&secondOperator=9.3234&operation=addition'

5.0919
```

Perform a subtraction operation:
```commandline
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/calculate?firstOperator=98.5&secondOperator=1.5&operation=subtraction'

97.0
```

Try to perform an unsupported operation:
```commandline
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/calculate?firstOperator=98.5&secondOperator=9.3234&operation=division'

{"statusCode":404,"timestamp":"2023-06-09T14:39:27.329+00:00","message":"No enum constant com.calculator.service.CalculatorService.Operation.DIVISION","description":"uri=/api/v1/calculate"}
```

Try to perform an operation providing only one operator:
```commandline
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/calculate?secondOperator=9.3234&operation=addition'

{"statusCode":404,"timestamp":"2023-06-09T14:40:08.829+00:00","message":"Required request parameter 'firstOperator' for method parameter type BigDecimal is not present","description":"uri=/api/v1/calculate"}
```
